# Online Shop Database Implementation

## About

This project focuses on designing and implementing a relational database using Oracle Database. It includes the creation of tables, defining relationships between them, and implementing PL/SQL subprograms for database operations. Additionally, triggers are employed at various levels to enforce data integrity and implement business rules within the database.

## Key Components

- **Oracle Database**: The relational database management system used for storing and managing data.
- **Tables**: Entities are represented as tables in the database, each with its own set of attributes.
- **Relationships**: Define relationships between tables using foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.
- **PL/SQL Subprograms**: Implement stored procedures and functions in PL/SQL for performing database operations such as insertion, updating, deletion, and querying.
- **Triggers**: Implement triggers at various levels (row-level and statement-level) to enforce business rules and maintain data consistency.
